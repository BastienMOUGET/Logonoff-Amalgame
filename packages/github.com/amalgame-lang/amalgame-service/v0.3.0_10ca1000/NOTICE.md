## Authorship

Copyright 2026 Bastien Mouget. The Amalgame facade code in this
repository is original work — see `facade.am` and the
`amalgame.toml` manifest.

This package is part of the Amalgame ecosystem
([github.com/amalgame-lang/Amalgame](https://github.com/amalgame-lang/Amalgame)).
It was extracted from amc's bundled `src/stdlib/service.am`
during the framework split (post-v0.7.5).

## Third-party content

None. The facade is 100% pure-Amalgame; a top-level `@c { … }`
block reaches the OS signal primitives (`sigaction` on POSIX,
`SetConsoleCtrlHandler` on Windows) without vendoring code.
